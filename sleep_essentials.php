Have you ever spent a night tossing and turning with a mind that just won't shut off? Or does it seem like the alarm wakes you up just as you're about to fall asleep? Do you wake up in a bed that looks like you just ran a marathon? Or, do you wake up frequently during the night and find it difficult to fall back asleep? Here are a few essential oils to help you sleep soundly:

            <h2 class="h2">LAVENDER</h2>

            <p>
              Lavender has been used throughout history for its diverse range of properties and enticing aroma. It balances and regulates our central nervous system, alleviating many of the negative effects of stress, such as irritability, anxiety, headaches, cramps, muscle pain, palpitations, and fatigue. It has been discovered that it relaxes brain wave patterns, with hospital studies in the United Kingdom demonstrating that the oil is useful for insomnia in the elderly. Lavender has calming effects when used in low doses, but it has the opposite effect when used in high doses. If you're having trouble sleeping, try putting a few drops of lavender on a tissue or cotton ball and placing it near your pillow.

            <h2 class="h2">SWEET MARJORAM</h2>

            <p>
             Marjoram is made up of over 30 different species, all of which are native to the Mediterranean and northern Africa. Sweet marjoram is made from dried flowering herbs, and its warming and comforting properties were widely used in ancient times to relieve stiff aching joints and muscle pain. It has antibacterial, antispasmodic, calming, digestive, nervine, and sedative properties. Marjoram has a calming and seductive effect on our parasympathetic nervous system, making it useful for anxiety, agitation, debility, insomnia, migraine, and nervous depression. When combined with ylang ylang or tangerine, marjoram is a potent oil to inhale when there is pain or distress. Its warming and pain-relieving properties as a massage oil may help with muscle aches and pains, arthritis, and painful periods.
