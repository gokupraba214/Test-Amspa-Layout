            <p>
              Acupressure is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) technique derived from acupuncture. It is a combination of acupuncture and finger pressure. Acupressure involves applying physical pressure to acupuncture points with the hand, elbow, or various tools.

            <p>
              Ayurveda is a natural health care system that originated in India and has been practised for thousands of years. Massage, yoga, meditation, and herbal remedies are all part of it. Abhyanga is a type of Ayurvedic massage that is typically performed by one or two therapists using a heated blend of herbal oils based on the ayurvedic dosha system.

            <p>
             Balinese traditional massage combines ancient traditions and practises with massage treatments to keep your body physically and spiritually balanced, leaving you feeling wonderfully refreshed and relaxed. Palm gliding, skin rolling, kneading, and long and firm stroking movements are among the techniques used. Aromatic oils are used by the massage therapist throughout the massage. This traditional treatment is said to improve a client's circulation and energy flow. A hot stone from Bali is an option.

            <p>
              Traditional Chinese massages are classified into two types: Tui na, which focuses on pushing, stretching, and kneading the muscles, and Zhi Ya, which focuses on pinching and pressing at acupressure points. Both are based on Traditional Chinese Medicine principles (TCM).

            <p>   
         Deep tissue massage combines Swedish massage movements with specialised finger and thumb techniques aimed at releasing tension held in the body's connective tissues. These precise penetrating movements effectively loosen contracted and stressed muscles, aid in the release of adhesions, and provide a general sense of deep relaxation. Deep tissue massage is frequently recommended for people who have chronic aches and pains, as well as those who engage in strenuous physical activity and sustain physical injuries, such as athletes.

            <p>
             Massage in the medical field includes decongestive therapy for lymph oedema, which can be used in conjunction with breast cancer treatment. Carotid sinus massage is used to diagnose carotid sinus syncope and can help distinguish supraventicular tachycardia (SVT) from ventricular tachycardia (VT). It, like the valsalva manoeuvre, is used to treat SVT. However, it is less effective than medication-based SVT management.

            <h2 class="h2">REFLEXOLOGY</h2>

            <p>
             Reflexology is a Chinese traditional massage therapy that is based on the idea that there are reflexes in the hands and feet that correspond to every organ, gland, and system in the body. The most common treatment focuses on applying pressure to the various reflexology points on the feet to induce soothing relaxation.

            <p>
             Shiatsu (shi means 'finger' and atsu means 'pressure') is an eastern therapy that incorporates stretching as well as pressure applied with thumbs, fingers, and palms to the same energy meridians as acupressure. It also employs rolling, brushing, vibrating, and grasping techniques. The client's back, legs, and feet are pressed.

            <p>
             Swedish massage is a technique that is used in most spas around the world to perform classic western massage. Swedish massage, developed in the early 1800s by Per Henrik Ling and refined by Johan Georg Mezger, is based on a series of comfortable flowing movements such as effleurage, petrissage, tapotement, and friction. These relaxing massage techniques have been shown to relieve general muscle aches and pains, joint stiffness, poor circulation, and stress.

            <p>
               Stone massage employs the use of cold or heated stones to apply pressure and heat to the body. The therapist can also use oil-coated stones to deliver various massage strokes. The stones are typically river stones that have become extremely polished and smooth over time. The heat from the stones penetrates the muscles, releasing tension, as they are placed along the recipient's back.

             In Thailand, this is known as nuat phaen boran, which translates to "ancient or traditional massage." Thai massage is a type of massage that originated in India and is based on ayurveda and yoga. During the massage, the technique combines massage with yoga-like positions. Stretching is emphasised in the northern style, while acupressure is emphasised in the southern style.
